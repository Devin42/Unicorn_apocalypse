    <h1>Unicorn Apocalypse</h1>
    <p>You wake up feeling the same as you have the last couple years, bored. You go through your morning routine and as you're making breakfast you feel like something is trying to pull you into deep sleep. You figure that it's drowsiness and wash your face with cold water. The toaster dings and you pull your toast out and spread it with butter and jam. You sit down in front of the TV, turn it on, and just as you are about to turn it on you the TV flashes. You hear, "Breaking news, death hungry Unicorns are running rampant on the streets of New York City. You drop your toast. You have a choice to make!" </p>
